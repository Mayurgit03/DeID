# DeID - Decentralized Identity Frontend Demo

A comprehensive frontend demonstration of a decentralized identity (dApp) that showcases self-sovereign digital identity features without requiring blockchain connectivity.

## üåü Features

### Core Identity Features
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Generate unique identities with proper DID document structure
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Manage credentials with full lifecycle support
- **NFT Identity Cards**: Beautiful identity card visualization with metadata
- **QR Code System**: Generate and scan QR codes for credential verification
- **Credential Management**: View, revoke, and export credentials

### Demo Features
- **No Wallet Required**: Simulated wallet connection for easy testing
- **Sample Data**: Pre-populated credentials and realistic demo data
- **Local Storage**: Persistent data using browser storage
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
- **Interactive UI**: Full feature demonstration without blockchain complexity

### User Experience
- **Clean Dashboard**: Overview of identity status and quick actions
- **Profile Management**: Complete identity profile with guardian system
- **Verifier Portal**: QR scanner and manual verification tools
- **Export Options**: PDF export and wallet integration mockups
